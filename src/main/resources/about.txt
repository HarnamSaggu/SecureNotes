	Secure notes:<br>
	<hr><br>
	This is an encrypted note-taking application.
	<br>
	You can whatever note you want, then have it further encrypted by AES.
	<br>
	Notes consist of a title, body and optional password (for extra security).
	<br>
	For password protected notes, to delete them you must enter your account password again.
	<br>
	If %d password checks are failed, your account will be locked for %d minutes.

	This is my (Harnam Saggu) first big project, hope you enjoy
