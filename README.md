Its as it seems.
First 'proper' application.
Hopefully this can land me job later on.
Hire me :) pls.


I did this entire project at 15 (turing 16 quite soon tho).
It took a few months due to long gaps inbetween.
The back-end as painful as it was, was all in all quite cool.
I hate front-end and so took a break after completing it.
I will add features to this project but under a diffrent repository.

I would have built a .jar but after hours of trying every conciable pom.xml nothing worked :(
And my deadline was nearing so :p
